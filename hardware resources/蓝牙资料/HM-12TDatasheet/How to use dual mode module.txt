1. Default baud rate is 115200, N, 8, 1.

2. module contains tow MAC address, 00:0E:0B:xx:xx:xx is BLE mode, 00:0E:0E:xx:xx:xx is EDR mode.

How to get high speed

1. Please use BLE mode with iOS and use SPP mode with other device.
2. Please use high baudrate if possible. such like 230400, 460800, 921600
3. Please open high speed mode, "AT+HIGH1"
4. Please send 60 Bytes per packet through module UART. 
   e.g. if you want send 1270 bytes per seconds, then you send 60 bytes per packet and interval 100ms between two packets.
